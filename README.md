# NEATFLIX

An android app built using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) that consumes [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) to display the current trending, upcoming, top rated, and popular movies and tv-shows. It also suggests films based on your watch list.

# Setup Requirements
First, obtain your API key from [TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) and add it in a file named `apikey.properties` within the root directory:

```bash
YOUR_API_KEY="****"
```

Then, replace it in the `build.gradle(:app)` :

```bash
...
buildConfigField("String", "YOUR_API_KEY", apikeyProperties['YOUR_API_KEY'])
```

Finally, rebuild the project for changes to take effect and don't forget to update the references of this key in the `APIService.kt` file.

```bash
...
@Query("api_key") apiKey: String = BuildConfig.YOUR_API_KEY,
```

- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Hilt provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
- [Jetpack Components](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
    - [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)- Modern toolkit for building native UI.
    - [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx.html) - Provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack and Android platform APIs.
    - [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) - Major improvement to the original Android [Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index), which is no longer maintained.
    -   [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments.
    - [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - Provides an abstraction layer over SQLite used for offline data caching.
    - [Preferences Datastore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) - Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers. DataStore uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally.
    - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
- [Compose Destinations](https://composedestinations.rafaelcosta.xyz/) - A KSP library that processes annotations and generates code that uses Official Jetpack Compose Navigation under the hood.
- [Accompanist - System UI Controller](https://github.com/google/accompanist/blob/main/systemuicontroller) - A library that provides easy-to-use utilities for recoloring the Android system bars from Jetpack Compose.
- [Landscapist - CoilImage Loader](https://github.com/skydoves/landscapist) - Landscapist is a Jetpack Compose image loading library which fetches and displays network images with **Glide**, **Coil**, and **Fresco**.
- [Compose Rating bar](https://github.com/a914-gowtham/compose-ratingbar) - A rating bar for Jetpack compose made by [@Gowtham](https://github.com/a914-gowtham).
- [Compose Pagination](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/paging) - The Paging Library makes it easier for you to load data gradually and gracefully within your app.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - Type-safe http client 
and supports coroutines out of the box.
- [Lottie Files for Compose](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie) - Lottie is a library for Android, iOS, and Web that parses [Adobe After Effects](http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) animations exported as json with [Bodymovin](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web) and renders them natively on mobile and on the web!
- [GSON](https://github.com/square/gson) - JSON Parser,used to parse 
requests on the data layer for Entities and understands Kotlin non-nullable 
and default parameters.
- [OkHttp Logging Interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor/README.md) - Logs HTTP request and response data.
- [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) - Library Support for coroutines.
- [Flows](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) - Flows are built on top of coroutines and can provide multiple values. A flow is conceptually a stream of data that can be computed asynchronously.
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - Library for easier logging.
- [Stetho]() - Stetho is a sophisticated debug bridge for Android applications. When enabled, developers have access to the Chrome Developer Tools feature natively part of the Chrome desktop browser.
